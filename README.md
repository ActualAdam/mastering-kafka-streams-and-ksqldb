# Bug Bounty
I hold myself and this book to a high standard. So if you find a bug in this repo's code or in the book's text, and you're the first to [open an issue][issue], your name will live forever in the book when I personally thank you (by name) in the book's acknowledgements. The code must break a demo or alter the logic of the application in some negative / unintended way.
